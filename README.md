Refresh ActiveRecord connection on each rack request 

## Installation

Add the following to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'activerecord-refresh_connection'
```

And then execute:

```plain
$ bundle
```

## How to Use

This gem provides a rack middleware `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::RefreshConnectionManagement` which disconnects all connections in each rack request, which results in refreshing all connections in each rack request. 

### Rails 5 and Rails 6

NOTE: activerecord-refresh_connection **does not work with puma, and webrick** server in rails 5 and rails 6.

```ruby
# config/application.rb
class Application < Rails::Application
  config.middleware.insert_before ActionDispatch::Executor,
    ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::RefreshConnectionManagement

  ## If you would like to clear connections after 5 requests:
  # config.middleware.insert_before ActionDispatch::Executor,
  #   ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::RefreshConnectionManagement, max_requests: 5
end
```

Middleware check. 

```bash
bundle exec rake middleware
```

Use unicorn server to run your application.

### Rails 4

NOTE: activerecord-refresh_connection **does not work with puma** server in rails 4.

Swap the default rails ConnectionManagement.

```ruby
# config/application.rb
class Application < Rails::Application
  config.middleware.swap ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::ConnectionManagement,
    "ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::RefreshConnectionManagement"

  ## If you would like to clear connections after 5 requests:
  # config.middleware.insert_before ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::ConnectionManagement,
  #   "ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::RefreshConnectionManagement", max_requests: 5
  # config.middleware.delete ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::ConnectionManagement
end
```

Middleware check. 

```bash
bundle exec rake middleware
```

### Sinatra

```ruby
# config.ru
require 'activerecord-refresh_connection'

use ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::RefreshConnectionManagement

## If you would like to clear connections after 5 requests:
# use ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::RefreshConnectionManagement, max_requests: 5

run App
```
